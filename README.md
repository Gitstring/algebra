Vectors, Matrices and more

# Disclaimer
This is alpha software.

There is no documentation by now ... let me implement some features: see
the [examples] (https://github.com/fibo/algebra/wiki/Examples) folder if you want a preview.

I'm planning to implement matrices and vectors on few algebra fields
(Reals, Complexes etc.) following Micheal Artin's "Algebra",
which was my book at Universita' Degli Studi di Genova.

My goal is to provide users with the feature of creating their own algebra field and building vector spaces and matrices on it.

Suppose for example the set of strings with the concatenation operator,
it could be extended to a group and maybe to a field and build "matrices of strings".

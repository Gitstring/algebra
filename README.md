Vectors, Matrices and more

# Disclaimer
This is alpha software.

I'm planning to implement matrices and vectors on few algebra fields
(Reals, Rationals, Quaternions, etc.) following Micheal Artin's "Algebra",
which was my book at Universita' Degli Studi di Genova.

My goal is to provide the feature of let the user create his own algebra field
and build vector spaces, matrices and other algebra structure on it.

Suppose for example the set of strings with the concatenation operator,
it could be extended to a group and maybe to a field and build "matrices of strings".

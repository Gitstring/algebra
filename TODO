example of complex space over custom field

1 byte is an octonion over booleans

be more semantic: transposition instead of transpose if it is static, transpose if it is a mutator, tha alias is the same (tr)
                  addition for the static operator, add for the mutator
                  subtraction for the static, subtract for the mutator
                  multiplication, multiply or better multiplyBy ... the alias is mul, that is the same

write src/ in es6, then use esperanto and a transpiler
